I'm a Data Science student based in Germany.

Currently teaching at TU-Dortmund and working on the project: [social (in)justice in the energy transition](https://www.oeko.de/news/pressemeldungen/projektstart-mehr-gerechtigkeit-in-der-energiewende/).

Also doing my Master's thesis in a resampling technique for spatial spectral densities building on the [work](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bernoulli/volume-21/issue-2/Testing-equality-of-spectral-densities-using-randomization-techniques/10.3150/13-BEJ584.full?tab=ArticleLink) of my supervisor, [Prof. Jentsch](https://lwus.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/lehrstuhl/arbeitsgruppe/jentsch/). It aims to improve performance for small samples.
